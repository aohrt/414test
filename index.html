            <p>I was born at Dragonstone, not that I can remember it. We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib, not that it matters now of course.</p>
            <p>I spent my life in foreign lands, so many men tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names.</p>
            <p>I have been sold like a broodmare, I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.</p>
            <p>Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods, not in myths and legends, in myself, in Daenerys Targaryen.</p>
            <p>The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea; they did for me.</p><br>
            <p>I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms, and I will.</p>
